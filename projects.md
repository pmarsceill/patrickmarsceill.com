* [My Desk](/2013/01/14/building-my-desk-part-one-the-frame/) is a project that I completed in the winter of 2012-2013. I built my desk out of galvanized steel pipes and an oak countertop.
* [_animate.scss](https://github.com/pmarsceill/_animate.scss) an SCSS port of Dan Eden's animate.css. It uses silent SCSS `@extend` s, so only the animations you use get printed to your compiled CSS file.
* [Jekyll Framer Studio Template](https://github.com/pmarsceill/Jekyll-Framer-Template) is a Jekyll template for publishing Framer Studio projects on the web. Drop in your `app.coffee` file, `images/` and `imported/` directories and this dude will do the rest.

* [A.M. Mills](https://www.facebook.com/pages/AM-Mills/1407256366204937) "Fans of the late, great Blood Feathers (or, if you are a truly old head, Aspera) may have recognized the sweet, dulcet Petty-ish tones of one Drew Mills opening up last night’s sold-out War On Drugs show at Union Transfer. And indeed, that was he, resurfacing for his first gig under the moniker A.M. Mills, with the above track going online this morning." -Philebrity

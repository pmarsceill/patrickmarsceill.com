* [My Desk](/2013/01/14/building-my-desk-part-one-the-frame/) is a project that I completed in the winter of 2012-2013. I built my desk out of galvanized steel pipes and an oak countertop.
* [Jekyll SEO Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-seo) A gem that allows users to check SEO on Jekyll based sites or blogs. Documentation and issues on the <a href="https://github.com/pmarsceill/jekyll-seo-gem">GitHub repo</a>.
* [_animate.scss](https://github.com/pmarsceill/_animate.scss) an SCSS port of Dan Eden's animate.css. It uses silent SCSS `@extend` s, so only the animations you use get printed to your compiled CSS file.

* [A.M. Mills](https://www.facebook.com/pages/AM-Mills/1407256366204937) "Fans of the late, great Blood Feathers (or, if you are a truly old head, Aspera) may have recognized the sweet, dulcet Petty-ish tones of one Drew Mills opening up last night’s sold-out War On Drugs show at Union Transfer. And indeed, that was he, resurfacing for his first gig under the moniker A.M. Mills, with the above track going online this morning." -Philebrity

<h1 class="page__title">Works: Mostly in Progress.</h1>

<p class="page__intro" markdown="1">I dedicate a large portion of my free time to projects that provide opprotunites for me to learn, make art, and contribute to various communities. Below is a list of things I have worked on or am currently working on. _These are all personal projects—not my professional portfolio—if you're specifically looking for that, please [email me]('mailto:patrick.marsceill@gmail.com') for more information._</p>

* [My Desk](/2013/01/14/building-my-desk-part-one-the-frame/) is a project that I completed in the winter of 2012-2013. I built my desk out of galvanized steel pipes and an oak countertop.
* [_animate.scss](https://github.com/pmarsceill/_animate.scss) an SCSS port of Dan Eden's animate.css. It uses silent SCSS `@extend` s, so only the animations you use get printed to your compiled CSS file.
* [Jekyll Framer Studio Template](https://github.com/pmarsceill/Jekyll-Framer-Template) is a Jekyll template for publishing Framer Studio projects on the web. Drop in your `app.coffee` file, `images/` and `imported/` directories and this dude will do the rest.
* [Jekyll Starter Files](https://github.com/pmarsceill/jekyll-starter-files) a skeleton Jekyll project pre-packaged with Modernizr and Grunt making use of Sass/SCSS + sourcemaps + autoprefixing, JS minification and concatonation, Grunticon SVG workflow. My go to when starting a new web project.

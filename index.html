      <p>Iâ€™ve designed and built websites and products for clients ranging from <em>Fortune 500</em> companies to <em>small startups</em>.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am a member of the creative team at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. Formerly, a Senior Designer at <a href="http://happycog.com">Happy Cog</a> and <a href="http://www.epam.com">Empathy Lab</a>. I write and speak about design and have been featured in publications like Smashing Magazine.</p>
      <p>My weekends are filled with side projects, music making, motorcycle riding repair, and backyard hanging. All of this goes down in Philadelphia, which I call my home.</p>

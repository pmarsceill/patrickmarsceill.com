When I think about motion design on the web, I cannot help but think about its roots in Flash. As a senior in high school, I sat at my local Borders reading Hillman Curtis’ _Flash Web Design_ absorbing all I could about the possibilities of this technology. In the fall of 2000, if a site required rich animation or motion-driven interactions, the odds were that Flash was the tool that was going to make it happen.

Regardless of Flash’s shortcomings as a content platform, as a design tool, it gave a lot of control to its users—especially in terms of motion design. The power to adjust an animation’s properties and instantly see the results allowed designers to consider motion as a pillar of design in the same way as typography or layout. When done well, motion design adds another dimension to how we relate to content. Like a typeface, it colors how information is perceived. Like a layout it re-prioritizes and frames ideas. 

More than ever before, today’s web can render authentic, meaningful, fluid animation without relying on 3rd party browser extensions. While the technologies to render this type of animation in the browser have evolved past Flash, there hasn’t quite been a tool that allows for it’s creation and iteration in the same way. The design artifacts that I create range in fidelity, but they typically describe a combination of: aesthetics, content, interaction, and behaviors. When we think of motion as one of these qualities, iteration proves challenging because it is hard to present in a realistic way before it is built and delivered. I might describe how I want something to move with words, or storyboard it on paper; but until I actually see the movement occur, its description is largely open to interpretation. The essence of the motion isn’t fully realized and it cannot be, until a more accurate and detailed articulation exists.

Where Flash may have gotten us thinking about motion design earlier in a process, as a tool it can only provide a means to end. In searching for other tools that might enable such means, I considered the balance of building cheap prototypes vs. fully functional HTML and CSS. Designing in the browser may work for some, but until a certain point when the fundamentals of a design are established, constraints are built, and patterns emerge, I find it too time consuming to attempt to code all the possible outcomes of decisions as they happen.

Designers have been [using Keynote for years](http://www.edenspiekermann.com/blog/espi-at-work-the-power-of-keynote) to mock up medium-fi design artifacts. Working this into my process proved challenging because compared a tool like Photoshop or Sketch, Keynote lacks the features for designing detailed aesthetic components. I started to see the tool differently when I came across [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) replicated [entirely in Keynote](http://vimeo.com/100377108). Rather than using Keynote as an aesthetic design tool, the author of this video, Andrew Haskin, recommends using it in combination with other design tools to prototype different types of animations. Being familiar with the simplicity Keynote’s animation options, I was skeptical in its ability to mock up anything resembling an elegant UI animation. I was pleasantly proven wrong when I [downloaded the Keynote source file](https://app.box.com/s/q06fnhk09asgvx94a5gy) and all of these animations were living right inside the slide deck.

> In my work, there’s constant discussion about which is the best and hottest new design tool to use. I’ve tried many of them, but in the end I still keep coming back to Keynote. It’s easy to learn and use, swapping assets is a breeze (using media placeholder), and most complex animations can be tested with Magic Move (the secret sauce to it all). Producing animations can span a range of fidelities; I can produce all the assets in Keynote, or I can copy out of Illustrator or drag and drop from Sketch (how seamless this works puts a smile on my face every time).

*Some Strengths*
- Simple, low learning curve
- Relatively quick to produce
- Relatively easy to update
- Free software that anyone with a Mac can use

*Some Limitations* 
- Can’t control animations in detail, limited to basic easing and timing
- Only a certain set of animations are supported
- Can’t easily collaborate
- Magic Move doesn’t easily support custom shapes
- Can’t trigger animations with different

### Framer Studio

- [Framer Studio](http://framerjs.com/) I came across recently
- “Framer Studio is built on Framer.js, an open source framework for rapid prototyping. Framer allows you to define animations and interactions. It runs on mobile devices, too.”
- Framer Studio imports a PSD or Sketch file and converts all the layers from those documents into single images that can be animated based on any number of events.
- With the workflow built in to the app, it makes setting design ideas in motion a much simpler experience than trying to manually do it in the browser
- Framer Studio utilizes [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (which compiles to JavaScript) to code interactivity and animations.
- Framer studio prototypes are generated as sharable HTML / CSS and JS files.
- Workflow: Import PSD into Framer Studio -> Use Framer Studio to prototype motion and interactivity -> Share HTML Prototypes
- Alternatively screen grab video of the prototype and convert to an animated gif which can be attached to GitHub pull requests and issues.

*Some Strengths*
- Workflow is simple
- Prototypes are easily shared and collaborated on
- Very detailed control of animation curves, easing, and interactions
- Forces designers to think about the code behind the animations sooner than later.
- Built on [open source JavaScript framework](http://framerjs.com/framerjs/) (can be used without Framer Studio)

*Some Limitations*
- Basic JavaScript / CoffeeScript knowledge is required
- Steeper learning curve
- Framer Studio is $49.99 per license

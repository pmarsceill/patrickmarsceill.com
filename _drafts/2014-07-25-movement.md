When I think about motion design on the web, I cannot help but think about its roots in Flash. As a senior in high school, I sat at my local Borders reading Hillman Curtis’ _Flash Web Design_ absorbing all I could about the possibilities of this technology. In the fall of 2000, if a site required rich animation or motion-driven interactions, the odds were that Flash was the tool that was going to make it happen.

Regardless of Flash’s shortcomings as a content platform, as a design tool, it gave a lot of control to its users—especially in terms of motion design. The power to adjust an animation’s properties and instantly see the results allowed designers to consider motion as a pillar of design in the same way as typography or layout. When done well, this thinking adds another dimension to how we relate to content. Like a typeface, it colors how information is perceived. Like a layout it re-prioritizes and frames ideas. 

More than ever before, today’s web can render authentic, meaningful, fluid animation without relying on 3rd party browser extensions like Flash. While the technologies to render this type of animation in the browser have evolved, there hasn’t quite been a tool that allows for it’s creation and iteration in the same way since Flash. The design artifacts that I create range in fidelity, but they typically describe a combination of: aesthetics, content, interaction, and behaviors. When I think of motion as one of these qualities, iteration proves challenging because it is hard to present in a realistic way before it is actually built. I might describe how I want something to move with words, or storyboard it on paper; but until I actually see the movement occur, it is still a rendition that is largely open to interpretation. This leaves the essence of the motion largely unrealized until a more accurate and detailed articulation exists.

Where Flash may have gotten us thinking about motion design earlier in a process, it was just a tool to provide a means to an end. In searching for other, more modern, tools that might allow such a means, I considered the balance of building cheap prototypes vs. fully functional HTML and CSS. Designing in the browser may work for some aspects of a design, but I’ve found that until the fundamentals are established, constraints are built, and patterns emerge, it is too time consuming and rigid a canvas for exploring and enabling divergence.

Designers have been talking about [using Keynote](http://www.edenspiekermann.com/blog/espi-at-work-the-power-of-keynote) to mock up medium-fi design artifacts for years. I have always found this challenging to work into my process because like Photoshop or Sketch, Keynote lacks the features for designing detailed aesthetic components. I started to see the tool differently when I came across [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) replicated [entirely in Keynote](http://vimeo.com/100377108). Rather than using Keynote as an aesthetic design tool, the author of this video, Andrew Haskin, recommends using it in combination with other design tools to prototype different types of animations. Being familiar with the simplicity Keynote’s animation options, I was skeptical in its ability to mock up anything resembling an elegant UI animation. Pleasantly, I was  proven wrong when I [downloaded the Keynote source file](https://app.box.com/s/q06fnhk09asgvx94a5gy) and all of these animations were living right inside the slide deck.

> In my work, there’s constant discussion about which is the best and hottest new design tool to use. I’ve tried many of them, but in the end I still keep coming back to Keynote. It’s easy to learn and use, swapping assets is a breeze (using media placeholder), and most complex animations can be tested with Magic Move (the secret sauce to it all). Producing animations can span a range of fidelities; I can produce all the assets in Keynote, or I can copy out of Illustrator or drag and drop from Sketch (how seamless this works puts a smile on my face every time). - Andrew Haskin, author of _Keynote does Material Design_

Keynote allows the creation of cheap, simple, easily understood motion design prototypes. The software has a low learning curve and is free (with Mavericks), which makes it good for cross-team collaboration. Where Keynote falls short, however, is in shaping the minutiae of an interaction. Because it is software designed for creating presentations; it doesn’t have the same event triggers as a webpage—things like hover, swipe, or touch. An animation must either occur on click, or immediately following another animation. Another potential limitation are the controls over an animation’s easing and timing. Keynote has four basic easing options: none, ease-in, ease-out, or both (no numeric inputs for these). Coupled with the use of other design tools and some creativity, Keynote can be a surprisingly powerful tool to start thinking about motion in your designs early in your design process.

If more granular control is what you’re after, [Framer Studio](http://framerjs.com/) might be the tool for you. In a lot of ways, using Framer for the first time reminded me of working in Flash. Framer Studio is a self contained application that fits nicely in a workflow of layered design artifacts. The designer is given the power to use the robust built-in animation library of Framer.js complete with custom animation curves, easing, and [full set of interactions](http://examples.framerjs.com/#event-basics.framer) found across all modern devices.

>  Framer Studio is built on Framer.js, an open source framework for rapid prototyping. Framer allows you to define animations and interactions. It runs on mobile devices, too. - http://framerjs.com

One of the nicest features of this app is the ability to import PSDs, After Effects, or Sketch files and bring the individual layers to life with interaction and motion design. While this is achieved by writing [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (a preprocessed version of JavaScript that gets compiled in the app), it is greatly more efficient to import these layers than try to recreate them in code. What’s even better is the the output is a completely self-contained package of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be shared in any modern web browser (desktop or mobile).

While Keynote has very few barriers to entry, Framer Studio has a couple that might make it not the right tool for everyone. With the current version at $79.99 per license, it can get rather pricey to use across large teams. If you’re a designer who has absolutely no coding experience, the CoffeeScript component will very foreign to you and will require some additional learning to get going—maybe an excuse to learn some code.

Regardless which tool you use, designing motion is only going to become more important as animation and interactions evolve on the web. Considering motion as a design component means iterating on it with the rest of the design system in whatever medium best expresses its intent. Motion design on the web has come a long way since the days that it was ruled by Flash, and it can be pushed even further through thoughtful design and execution.

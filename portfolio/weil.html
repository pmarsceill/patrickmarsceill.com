        <p class="display-beta mb-5">Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges is one of the largest lawfirms in the world. With 20 offices spanning 3 continents and 9 countries, their content needs were unlike any I&rsquo;ve ever designed for.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Weil&rsquo;s clients include businesses across many industries and countries, partnering with people with an array of job titles. Serving such a diverse group meant spotlighting  utility and wayfinding as a key requirement. Behind the design, our team architected a set of content relationships between people, business sectors, practice groups, and locations to provide the backbone for this rich responsive experience.</p>

        <h3 class="display-beta">With a history deeply rooted in diversity, Weil's new site had to put its people at the forefront.</h3>

          <div class="one-half column">
            <p>Our process began with a content strategy phase, giving way to many sketches of the system showing how different content relationships could be formed. I worked on building a set of HTML wireframes that evolved into production code as we moved further along through the design process.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-gamma">86% of executives use their tablet (72% on smartphone) to conduct research for products or services for their business.*</h3>
        <p>Mobile was extremely important to Weil and their audiences. After content was defined, we utilized a mobile-first design approach, ensuring that there wasnâ€™t an anemic experience on any device.</p>

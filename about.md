    <p class="page__intro" markdown="1">I'm happiest when I'm making, designing, or building. At [Happy Cog](http://happycog.com), I work as a Senior Designer alongside some of the best people creating websites and applications. My weekends are filled with music making, code wrangling, motorcycle riding, vector bending, and backyard hanging. All of this goes down in Philadelphia, which I call my home.</p>

## My Musical Background

I grew up playing music. When I was seven years old I started taking piano lessons, which soon gave way to drum lessons—and for a few years—bass lessons. From the time I was a teenager I played drums and sang in bands, dreaming of making a career out of it. In 2003 until 2012, I toured around the United States and Canada in between freelance jobs and on vacation days. Here are some of the records I worked on during that time:

### About This Site

I designed and built this site because I wanted an outlet to share the things I'm working on or thinking about. It runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the headings are set in [Grilli Type](http://www.grillitype.com/)'s _GT Walsheim_ and the body in [Exljbris](http://exljbris.com)'s _Calluna_. All iconography and illustration was designed by me.

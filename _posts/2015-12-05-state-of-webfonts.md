Thinking a lot about the current state of webfonts... There are many cases where the the performance hit / jerky loading / flash of invisible content (FOIC) isn't worth aesthetic  gains. Some solve it by progressively loading the fonts with JavaScript. Throwing JavaScript at the problem seems counter intuiative to me.

Are you designer who enjoys building products and wants to work on a highly visible one? I'm looking to a [hire code-conscious product designer][e7d0e273] to join my team at [GitHub][05966cd1].

  [05966cd1]: https://github.com "GitHub"
  [e7d0e273]: https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/580527#.WNvkI1KZNjA "GitHub's Product Designer job application"

## What this position is

This is a product design position. You'll be working with product managers, engineers, design managers, and other product designers to define, design,  and build features on GitHub dot com. You'll research, sketch, create mockups, write code, and deploy to production. You'll probably introduce a few bugs â€” its cool, we all do. Your work will be reviewed and you will review others' work. You will use GitHub to build GitHub.

### Is this position remote?

Not right now. Currently, we're looking to expand our product design team in San Francisco, and we're not considering remote applicants for this position  (this might change as our team becomes more geographically balanced).

### The types of projects you'll be working on

GitHub builds products for developers, businesses, open source organizations, educational institutions, government agencies and just about anyone who is involved in building and shipping software. About 20 million people currently use GitHub.com around the world.

My group within the product design team primarily focuses on the businesses that use GitHub, as well as the integrators that build products that extend our platform in various ways. This means you'll get to work on stuff like:

-   Providing organizations enterprise-class tools to help manage and support teams of all sizes
-   Helping developers discover and install integrations to add functionality to their projects on GitHub
-   Giving integrators a great experience to build integrations on top of, extending the core functionality of GitHub

Additionally, you'll provide input and feedback that helps influence the direction of other product designers working on other areas of GitHub.

#### This will be a good fit for you if...

-   You have a few years experience designing software or websites
-   You can talk and write about your work
-   You're comfortable with people having strong opinions about your work and are comfortable sharing yours
-   You have some experience with HTML and CSS (you should be able to write markup and styles)
-   You can work within a defined design system, but also know when to break outside of it
-   You've used GitHub before, are familiar with modern developer workflows, or are willing to learn

#### You might not be right for this position if...

-   You've never held a professional design position before
-   Are passionate about design, but don't have a desire to expand your front-end development skills
-   You're more passionate about designing marketing experiences ([we're hiring those types of web designers also](http://sophieshepherd.com/2017/03/17/hiring-a-web-designer.html))
-   You aren't comfortable having autonomy over your work

If you don't check all the boxes above, that's okay... Depending on a candidate's interviews and response to our design exercise we've been known to make exceptions.

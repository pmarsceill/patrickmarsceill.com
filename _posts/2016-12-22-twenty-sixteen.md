I typically don’t write year-end reflection posts. Hell, I don’t share a lot of writing in general. But I suppose the only way to write more is use events like the passing of a year as a catalyst to reflect and share ideas for the future.

In September of 2015 I started working on the design team at [GitHub][79747fe4]. This is my first time I've had a remote job since I began in tech ten years ago. Spending last quarter of 2015 figuring out what the fuck I was actually doing in my role at GitHub, by the end of the year, I wasn't leaving the house very much and it was wearing on me
. In the beginning of 2016 I set out to change my working habits to allow for a healthier remote lifestyle. I still wouldn't consider myself an expert in this, but a few things helped me feel less crazy.

1.  I began regular co-working sessions with other remote employees that I knew
2.  When I could, I worked from coffee shops (even if I was by myself)
3.  I used my flexible schedule to my advantage and had breakfast with my family every morning before work
4.  I joined a gym and started regular sessions with a trainer multiple times per week
5.  When the weather was warm, I took my daughter (almost 2 years old now) to happy hour once a week

As I made these changes, I found that my work got better, I was happier, and I began one of the most productive and rewarding periods in my career. We launched a ton of shit at GitHub in 2016 and we're setting 2017 up for even more.

In 2016, my role at GitHub shifted from being a lead designer on the _site_ team (logged out, marketing experiences of GitHub) to a Product Design Manager. My first time in a management role, I have a lot to work on.
